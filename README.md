## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15 App Router** with Partial Prerendering
- **Tailwind 4** + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Drizzle ORM** for typed PostgreSQL access
- **Wagmi** & **RainbowKit** for smart wallet onboarding
- **AgentKit** for on-chain AI actions
- **OnchainKit** components for Coinbase Commerce payments
- **Vercel Edge** API routes

## Tracks Applied

### AI
Our platform integrates an AgentKit-powered assistant backed by GPT‚Äë4o. It can fetch wallet details, query on-chain data, request faucet funds, mint decentralized IDs, and execute custom actions such as swapping ETH for USDC via [lib/agentkit/uniswap-v2-action-provider.ts](lib/agentkit/uniswap-v2-action-provider.ts).

### Stablecoins
Subscriptions are paid in USDC through Coinbase Commerce. Each payment is mirrored on-chain and we store the transaction hash to keep history immutable.

### DeFi
The Uniswap action provider lets the AI agent perform ETH ‚ûú USDC swaps on Base Sepolia. This demonstrates seamless DeFi interactions inside the hiring workflow.

### Consumer / Showcase
Rivalidate is a complete recruiting platform for candidates and recruiters. Users onboard with smart wallets and mint verifiable credentials as NFTs, showcasing a polished product ready for production.

## The Problem It Solves

Credential fraud slows down hiring and reduces trust in candidate r√©sum√©s. Rivalidate issues verifiable credentials onchain and links them directly to r√©sum√© data, allowing recruiters to instantly verify authenticity while candidates retain control over their profile.

---

## Challenges I Ran Into

- Coordinating smart contracts with off-chain Next.js logic
- Handling wallet onboarding flows for both web2 and crypto‚Äënative users
- Integrating AgentKit actions with custom contracts and Uniswap
- Mirroring Coinbase Commerce charges onchain and storing proofs
