## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15 App Router** with Partial Prerendering
- **Tailwind 4** + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Drizzle ORM** for typed PostgreSQL access
- **AgentKit** for on-chain AI actions
- **OnchainKit** components for Coinbase Commerce payments
- **Vercel Edge** API routes

## Tracks Applied

### AI
Our platform integrates an AgentKit-powered assistant backed by GPT‚Äë4o. It can fetch wallet details, query on-chain data, request faucet funds, mint decentralized IDs, and execute custom actions such as swapping ETH for USDC via [lib/agentkit/uniswap-v2-action-provider.ts](lib/agentkit/uniswap-v2-action-provider.ts).

### Stablecoins
Subscriptions are paid in USDC through Coinbase Commerce. Each payment is mirrored on-chain and we store the transaction hash to keep history immutable.

### DeFi
The Uniswap action provider lets the AI agent perform ETH ‚ûú USDC swaps on Base Sepolia. This demonstrates seamless DeFi interactions inside the hiring workflow.

### Consumer / Showcase
Rivalidate is a complete recruiting platform for candidates and recruiters. Users onboard with smart wallets and mint verifiable credentials as NFTs, showcasing a polished product ready for production.

## The Problem It Solves

Hiring marketplaces struggle with credential fraud and slow verification processes. **Rivalidate** anchors credentials directly on **Base**, giving recruiters cryptographic proof that a candidate truly earned their certificates.  
Crucially, **issuers** ‚Äî universities, bootcamps, licensing bodies, etc. ‚Äî sign and publish those credentials, providing the authoritative link between a candidate and their achievements; without the issuer‚Äôs signature, a credential cannot be verified on-chain.  
Smart-wallet onboarding lowers the barrier for non-crypto users, and an integrated AI agent assists with on-chain actions such as DID creation, token swaps, and payments. The result is a trust layer for professional credentials combined with efficient, AI-powered recruiting tools.

Traditional hiring relies on screenshots, PDFs, or phone calls to validate a r√©sum√©. Each manual check slows time-to-hire and still leaves room for fraud:

| Pain Point | Impact | Rivalidate‚Äôs Fix |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **Fake or inflated credentials** | Recruiters waste hours verifying each claim and still miss sophisticated forgeries. | Issuers publish cryptographically signed credentials to Base; recruiters get an instant green-check or red-flag. |
| **Fragmented data silos** | R√©sum√© data lives in dozens of HR tools; verification results aren‚Äôt portable. | Credentials are anchored on-chain and referenced by DID, so any HR system can fetch the same immutable proof. |
| **High Web3 friction** | Candidates and employers unfamiliar with wallets avoid on-chain solutions. | Coinbase Smart Wallet onboarding works with email, social, or passkeys ‚Äî no seed phrases required. |
| **Trust gaps in remote hiring** | Global teams struggle to judge overseas certifications. | A global, public Base chain provides a universal source of truth, independent of geography. |

By turning each claim into a verifiable credential minted (and, if revoked, transparently burned) on Base, Rivalidate removes the ‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù loop and lets recruiters focus on candidate fit rather than detective work.

## Challenges I Ran Into

| Challenge | Why It Was Hard | Approach & Solution |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **On-chain ‚ÜîÔ∏è Off-chain orchestration** | Smart-contract calls must stay in strict sync with Next.js server state (e.g., account creation ‚Üí NFT anchor). | Introduced an action queue in Drizzle + contract event listeners that update Postgres only after tx confirmation; retries handle L2 reorgs. |
| **Wallet onboarding for mixed audiences** | Web2 users fear seed phrases; crypto-native users expect hardcore self-custody. | Integrated Coinbase Smart Wallet with ‚ÄúsmartWalletOnly‚Äù preference, then exposed optional export for hardware-wallet users. |
| **Extending AgentKit with custom actions** | Native AgentKit only covers generic ERC-20 flows. | Wrote a uniswapv2ActionProvider and a credential-mint action that wrap our contracts; added Zod schemas so the agent can validate parameters before calling. |
| **Mirroring Coinbase Commerce payments on-chain** | Fiat checkout happens off-chain, but recruiters want on-chain proofs for audits. | Created a webhook that mints a zero-value ‚ÄúPaymentReceipt‚Äù NFT when a charge is marked CONFIRMED; the token links to the Commerce charge ID so auditors can cross-check. |
| **Ensuring issuer accountability** | If an issuer‚Äôs private key is compromised, fake credentials could be minted. | Added a revocation registry and an optional multisig flow for high-value issuers; the AI agent can trigger ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù actions if anomaly detection flags unusual minting. |

Together these solutions allowed Rivalidate to deliver a seamless, fraud-resistant credential layer while remaining usable by HR teams that have never touched a blockchain.
